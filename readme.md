## Mongoose-MongoDB-Errors

A plugin to transform mongodb like errors (E.G. "11000 - duplicate key") into Mongoose ValidationError instances.
This plugin takes advantage of the recently introduced [Error Handling Middlewares](http://thecodebarbarian.com/mongoose-error-handling.html) on
mongoose 4.5.

So, unfortunately you must be using the latest mongoose to use this plugin.
